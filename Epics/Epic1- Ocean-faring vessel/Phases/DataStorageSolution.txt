film storage for 4k video:
110gb/hour -> 2.4TB/day -> 240TB/100 days

HPE LTO(Linear Tape Open) 8 Tape with Barium Ferrite (BaFe) 12TB storage capability for just $6/TB

So the tape drive for LTO8 is most expensive so might make sense to use a lower number lto for a cheaper drive.
will potentially need autoloader as well; might need to make ourselves.
