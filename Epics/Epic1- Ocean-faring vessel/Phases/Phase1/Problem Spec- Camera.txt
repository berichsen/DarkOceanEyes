Summary of the problem:
We need a camera that can record video of the ocean as the boat travels. The camera needs to be able to run
for 24 hours a day for many months, and be able to capture video in a variety of light conditions. It'd also
be nice if the video was date-time stamped and geolocation stamped. Due to potential rough water, there should
be some sort of stabilization, but that can proabably be done on the processing video side, post mission. If we want
to record really deep parts of the ocean, the boat can stay on the surface, and the camera be connected by a long
cabe with a camera at the end and can take video. We want video of the ocean in general. This camera is not necessary
specific, minute details, but will allow us or scientists to analyze the video to see where it'd be more interesting
to further explore e.g. various potential new species spotted, pollution problems etc.

Questions to answer:
How large should the aperature be?
How large should the field depth be?

What are the requirements that the solution must have?
 - records video
 - handle a variety of high and low light situations across the spectrum
 - can record video nonstop for months at a time.
 - can handle various shallow depths; not so deep where you need a strobe (not sure if possible)
 - Wide focal length
 - minimal backscatter
 - Prime lens


 Why does this problem need to be solved?

Simply stated, the lux is the metric unit for measuring the amount of light that falls on an object, and is the European equivalent of the British foot-candle (or lumen).
