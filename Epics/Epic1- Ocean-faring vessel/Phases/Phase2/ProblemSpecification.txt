#CPU Problem Specification
##Summary of the problem:
We need a digital processing unit to do tasks such as processing and storing video, navigating the boat with the propeller and gps,
communicating with the satellite and bluetooth controller, managing power, and tracking various metrics and logs of the boat.
We must consider temperature ranges, possible EMI, processing power, number of cores, instruction set architecture, I/O connection protocols,
number of bits in word etc.
We can choose either a cpu, micrprocessor, microcontroller.

##What are the requirements that the solution must have?
- We must be able to purchase 1,000s of this cpu or maybe a similar cpu
- It must consume a low amount of power
- It must be able communicate with various I/O such as hard disk, video camera,
compass, propeller controller, led controller, gps module, satellite communication module
 and bluetooth module
- It must be compatible with common standard I/O components that we may use in the future 
 
##Why does this problem need to be solved?
To have an autonomous, self driving vehicle, it must have a cpu to orchestrate our stored
program of instructions to drive the boat, take video, and various other functions.

##Why is this the most important problem to solve next?
The computer system orchestrates and electronically commands the components of the boat.
We need to determine a good cpu, before we can determine other electronic components that
are compatible.
