# DarkOceanEyes
We are a designing unmanned autonomous vehicles to video every cubic kilometer of the ocean. We are the only people in the world working on the important problem of trying to explore
the entire ocean, and we need your help.

##The Problem
About 85% of the ocean is unexplored. The ocean contains life-saving medical treatments through fish, important history, species that would further elucidate
evolution, exploitable natural resources, information on human pollution impact and global warming, and much more. Due to the death and destruction of marine
life, we may kill many species of fish before we can even study them, losing knowledge about life on Earth FOREVER. We are missing out on a lot of knowledge
that can change the course of humanity for the better. The progress and innovation has been slow and unimpressive. For the year 2021, when I write this, I
find this unacceptable.

##Our Solution
We want to send unmanned autonomous vehicles across the entire volume of the ocean and record it on video. To get a video of the ocean, would mean at least
we have a visual picture of the ocean before a large percentage potentially gets destroyed.

##What We Will Achieve
We think the video footage will have the following benefits:
	- A better holistic understanding of the ocean
	- Discover of new species of marine life
	- Inspire others to explore the ocean
	- Understand the effects of pollution

We think our freely available designs:
	- Bring down the costs of unmanned autonomous vehicles

##Why us?
If we didn't tackle this issue, would someone else? We found the answer to be a resounding no! Yes, there are organizations that are making
nice progress with ocean exploration, but we find this progress to be slow and uninspiring. We want this done faster because we understand that
time is not on our side!
