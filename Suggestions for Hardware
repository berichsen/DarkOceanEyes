Proposed Hardware:

Computer System:

ESP32-CAM 
Programmable in JavaScript using Espruino.js 
(Also programmable in C++). 
Supports Ad-Hoc data transfer over wifi and (experimental) BLE.
Supports SDIO data transfer. 
Built-in SDHC card reader, supports up to 16GB microSD
Compatible with SDIO card reader modules which can interface with microSD-UHS cards of up to 128TB. 


The ESP32-CAM is based upon the ESP32-S module, so it shares the same specifications.  It has the following features:
* 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi
* Bluetooth 4.2 with BLE
* UART, SPI, I2C and PWM interfaces
* Clock speed up to 160 MHz
* Computing power up to 600 DMIPS
* 520 KB SRAM plus 4 MB PSRAM
* Supports WiFi Image Upload
* Multiple Sleep modes
* Firmware Over the Air (FOTA) upgrades possible
* 9 GPIO ports
* Built-in Flash LED

Max power consumption:
~240mA @ ~3.7v
MUCH less when on-board WiFi and BLE modules are disabled


Nav System:

Camera system:
Integrated into ESP32-CAM microcontroller 

The ESP32-CAM includes an OV2640 camera module. The device also supports OV7670 cameras.  The OV2640 has the following specifications:
* 2 Megapixel sensor
* Array size UXGA 1622×1200
* Output formats include YUV422, YUV420, RGB565, RGB555 and 8-bit compressed data
* Image transfer rate of 15 to 60 fps

Telemetry Options: 
- mesh-networking ($0 cost per-unit since the esp32 is capable of mesh networking), requires more units in the field)
- Satellite-networking (Iridium Sat Network I2C Modem is ~$250 per-unit + $15/mo)

5-10 TBD.
